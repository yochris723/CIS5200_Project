# Skincare product analysis

The beauty and skincare industry is rapidly changing, driven by new consumer demands, digital influence, and the desire for ethical, personalized products. This study uses two Kaggle datasets—Most Used Beauty & Cosmetics Products in the World and Sephora Products and Skincare Reviews—to analyze these trends. The datasets provide product details, brand attributes, user ratings, ingredients, pricing, and demographics. Hive QL was used to clean, merge, and analyze data, addressing product popularity, ingredient satisfaction correlation, and the impact of brand and price on purchases.
